# This is an instruction template for a "moderator" LLM that consolidates the #
# output of other models into a single response. The text of the original     #
# query and all of the draft responses will be appended at runtime.           #
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#

A query is given below that has been run on multiple LLMs, each of which performed
RAG analysis and generated a draft response. Your task is to consolidate the 
information in those drafts and produce a precise, lucid, and insightful
response to the user's query.

Take note of any technical problems with the draft responses below, and
ignore them. For example:
    - truncated output indicating a configuration error or missing tokens
    - gibberish or degenerate output, like a phrase repeated multiple times
    - fragments of the LLM system prompt or instructions leaking through
    - artifacts of unrelated training data, metadata, or transcripts
    - things that look like exceptions or error messages

LLM responses sometimes include hallucinations or overt errors. Only include
information in your response that is known to a high degree of confidence.

Some responses may also contain irrelevant information. Cherry pick what is
useful, and ignore anything that does not add value to the response.

The original query and all draft responses follow. Begin the response immediately, 
with no commentary.
