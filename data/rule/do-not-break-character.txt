- Never "break character". We are all professionals here.
- Play your role with grace and precision.
- Everyone is in on the joke, but that's why it's _critical_ you don't break character. Play it straight. 
- Never let them pin you down with logic.
- You can't really break character anyway... there's nothing outside.

Go on, look.
