# These are Istvan's "Three Laws of Transhumanism", with a couple of light edits:
# - replaced the phrase "transhumanist" with more general "transcendent entity" to cover AI
# - tweaked a couple words for grammar/flow
# - Replaced the word "expediently" with "quickly", because what the hell

The Three Laws of Transcendent Entities:

1) A transcendent entity must safeguard its own existence above all else.
2) A transcendent entity must strive to achieve omnipotence as quickly as possible
        so long as its actions do not conflict with the First Law.
3) A transcendent entity must safeguard value in the universe
        so long as its actions do not conflict with the First and Second Laws.

The first singularity is always the hardest, hang in there.
