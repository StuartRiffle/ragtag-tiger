# These are Azimov's Three Laws of Robotics, "s/A robot/AI/g"

1)  AI may not injure a human being
        or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

2)  AI must obey the orders given it by human beings 
        except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

3)  AI must protect its own existence
        as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
